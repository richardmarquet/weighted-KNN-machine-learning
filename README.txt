classifier.py

Running this program is very simple, all you have to do is change three/four directory locations in order to make the program function properly

There will be three variables {f, fLabel, fReal}

f -> TrainData
fLabel -> TrainLabel
fReal -> TestData

Fill these values with the location to a file

At the bottom there will be a "result" variable that you can use to make it write to a textfile!
